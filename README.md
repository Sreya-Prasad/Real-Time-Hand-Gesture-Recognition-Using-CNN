# Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-CNN
An advanced human-computer interaction model using Convolutional Neural Networks  (CNNs) to interpret hand gestures in real time.
The proposed system for real-time hand gesture recognition integrates three key technologies: OpenCV, Gesture AI, and MediaPipe. OpenCV, a renowned open-source computer vision library, provides a robust toolkit for real-time image processing and machine learning, making it ideal for detecting and recognizing hand gestures with speed and accuracy. Gesture AI complements this by leveraging deep learning algorithms, particularly CNNs and RNNs, to predict hand gestures swiftly using pre-trained models trained on extensive datasets. Lastly, MediaPipe offers a versatile framework for building pipelines for real-time signal processing, featuring a pre-trained hand pose estimator capable of detecting 21 hand key points, facilitating gesture recognition even in challenging conditions like low light or cluttered backgrounds. By combining these technologies, the proposed system enables efficient and accurate real-time hand gesture recognition, suitable for a wide range of applications from interactive games to virtual assistants.
